# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is "Nuggetroid Arcade", a React-based game arcade application designed for easy game development. The project uses a modular architecture where new games can be added by simply creating a folder structure under `src/games/`, and the main application will automatically discover and route to them.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start the Vite development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19+ with React Router DOM
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4+ (using PostCSS)
- **Linting**: ESLint with React hooks and refresh plugins
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (configured with `/nuggetroidarcade/` basename)

## Architecture

### Auto-Discovery Game System

The application uses Vite's `import.meta.glob` feature to automatically discover games:

```javascript
const gameModules = import.meta.glob('./games/**/*.jsx', { eager: true });
```

This scans `src/games/` for any `.jsx` files and automatically creates routes and menu entries for them.

### Game Structure

Each game should follow this structure:
```
src/games/
├── game-name/
│   ├── game-name.jsx          # Main game component (default export)
│   └── game-name-AI-notes.md  # Optional AI development notes
```

The folder name becomes the URL path (e.g., `/word-wizard`), and the display name is auto-generated by capitalizing and spacing the folder name.

### Routing Configuration

- **Base Path**: `/nuggetroidarcade/` (configured for GitHub Pages)
- **Home Route**: `/` - Shows the game menu
- **Game Routes**: Automatically generated from folder names in `src/games/`

## Configuration Files

### PostCSS Setup
The project uses CommonJS syntax for PostCSS configuration due to Tailwind CSS 4+ requirements:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### Tailwind Configuration
Uses standard Tailwind 4+ setup with content scanning configured for the project structure.

### ESLint Rules
- Uses modern ESLint flat config
- Includes React hooks and refresh plugins
- Custom rule: `no-unused-vars` with exception for uppercase constants

## Adding New Games

1. Create a new folder under `src/games/` with a kebab-case name
2. Add a `.jsx` file with the same name as the folder
3. Export a default React component
4. The game will automatically appear in the menu and be routable

## Current State

The project structure is set up but the individual game files (`word-wizard.jsx`, `history-ninja.jsx`) are currently empty and need to be implemented. The auto-discovery system and routing are functional.

## Known Issues

Previous setup encountered PostCSS configuration issues that have been resolved by using the current CommonJS configuration format and proper Tailwind CSS 4+ dependencies.
