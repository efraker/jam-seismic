JEROME MAURSETH, P.E., Ph.D.
U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (RETIRED)

My name is Jerome Maurseth and I'd like to share some insights from my decades as a civil engineer with the US Army Corps of Engineers. 

During my career, I've witnessed firsthand the critical importance of understanding how structures respond to various forces, particularly seismic activity. The principles of structural dynamics, soil-structure interaction, and earthquake engineering have been central to my work in designing resilient infrastructure.

Through these interactive simulations, I hope to demonstrate key engineering concepts that have guided my professional practice. From understanding natural frequencies and damping ratios to visualizing how different structural parameters affect building response during earthquakes, these tools aim to make complex engineering principles more accessible and intuitive.

My experience has taught me that the best way to understand structural behavior is through visualization and hands-on exploration. These simulations represent decades of engineering knowledge distilled into interactive demonstrations that I hope will benefit students, fellow engineers, and anyone curious about how the built environment responds to natural forces.
